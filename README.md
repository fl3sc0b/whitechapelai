# whitechapelai
An AI-engine to play the board game _"Letters from Whitechapel"_ in the role of Jack. Written 100% in the Scala language. Collaborations are accepted !!
## Project description
whitechapelai is an artificial intelligence engine to play the board game _"Letters from Whitechapel"_ (written by Gabriele Mari and Gianluca Santoprietro) in the role of Jack. _"Letters from Whitechapel"_ is an asymettrical game that includes hidden movement and important strategic and tactical components while keeps a set of minimalist rules. Designing a computer player able to defeat the human players represents a true challenge for a developer!
Also, part of this project is about experimentation with the Scala language. An immediate choice for writting an AI-engine well might been Python or more generalist languages like C# or Java, but in this case I'm interested in seeing how the excellent expressiveness features of Scala may fit here.

## Current status
I'm looking for contributors to speed up the development a bit (see section below). Still, some progress has been made:
- Model for the board :heavy_check_mark:
- Jack to choose his hideout analytically :heavy_check_mark:
- Package set up for unit testing with Scalatest :heavy_check_mark:
- Package set up for metadocumentation with Scaladoc :heavy_check_mark:
- Wiki :construction:
- First part: Hell :construction:
